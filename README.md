## 📄 Description

- **`datasets/`**  
  Contains image data used for photonic analysis of UC blocks. Each subfolder represents a unique UC block (`block_x`, `block_y`, `block_u`). Each of them contains the images required to form the bag of features for that block. 

- **`attack_circuits/`**  
  Each subfolder contains a dataset of images used to carry out attacks on a specific UC implementation of a circuit.
